# DefGen
This directory contains all the files necessary to run the Abaqus UMAT developed at the University of Bristol for the simulation of the compaction behaviour of uncured prepreg under 
processing conditions.

The related work was conducted at the University of Bristol under the EPSRC funded research grants: 
* Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Composites project “Defect Generation Mechanisms in Thick and Variable Thickness Composite Parts – Understanding, Predicting and Mitigation” (DefGen), grant reference no. EP/I033513/1.
* SIMulation of new manufacturing PROcesses for Composite Structures (SIMPROCS), grant reference no. EP/P027350/1.
