# PlyExtraction
PlyExtraction is a MATLAB tool can process laminate sample images and construct detailed geometric finite element models in Abaqus file format. The finite element models can be used directly for structural and strength simulations to analyse the effect of ply waviness defects.

The related work was conducted at the University of Bristol under the EPSRC funded platform grant ‘Simulation of new manufacturing Processes for Composite Structures (SIMPROCS)’ (grant no. EP/P027350/1).
