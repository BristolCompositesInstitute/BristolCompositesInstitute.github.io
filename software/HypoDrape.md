# HypoDrape
Hypodrape is a usermaterial subroutine (VUMAT) for Abaqus/Explicit used to define the mechanical constitutive behaviour of biaxial textile materials for simulating fabric drape and forming. 

The related work was conducted at the University of Bristol under the EPSRC funded research grant: Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Composites project 
“Defect Generation Mechanisms in Thick and Variable Thickness Composite Parts – Understanding, Predicting and Mitigation” (DefGen), grant reference no. EP/I033513/1.
