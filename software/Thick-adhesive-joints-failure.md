# Thick adhesive joints failure

This is an LS-Dyna UMAT developed at the University of Bristol for the simulation of thick adhesive joints failure.

The related work was conducted at the University of Bristol in the BMAX project funded by the Technology Strategy Board and the EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2012 award (EP/K503484/1).
