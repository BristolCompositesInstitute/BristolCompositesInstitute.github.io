# Multi-scale 2D woven accounting for in-plane shear

This is a two-module Python package for:
1. Obtaining in-plane sheared RVE material properties in any in-plane direction.
2. Using the sheared RVE properties in a component level shell model. This module requires a forming simulation and its associated VUMAT can be found in [HypoDrape]({% link HypoDrape.md %}). Please ask for the **HypoDrape-2D-woven** version when requesting access to the HypoDrape software.

The related work was conducted at the University of Bristol for Meng yi's PhD funded by Jaguar Land Rover and the EPSRC [iCase XXXXX] (EP/[]).
