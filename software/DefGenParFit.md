# DefGen Parameter Extraction
This directory contains the implementation of the parameter extraction framework used for the analysis of the compaction data within the DefGen ProToCoL material model.

This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the Centre for Doctoral Training in Advanced Composites Collaboration for Innovation and Science (grant number EP/L016028/1) and SIMulation of new manufacturing PROcesses for Composite Structures (SIMPROCS) (grant number EP/P027350/1).
