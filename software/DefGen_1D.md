# DefGen 1D model
This directory contains all the files of the DefGen ProToCoL material model (Python implementation) for the modelling of the toughened prepregs’ compaction response under processing conditions.

This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the Centre for Doctoral Training in Advanced Composites Collaboration for Innovation and Science (grant number EP/L016028/1) and SIMulation of new manufacturing PROcesses for Composite Structures (SIMPROCS) (grant number EP/P027350/1).
