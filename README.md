# Bristol Composites Institute

This is the home of modelling code developed by the BCI (previously ACCIS) to 
support our research, and made available for use by the academic community.

See [our web page](https://bristolcompositesinstitute.github.io) for details.

Much of the code is located in private repositories to which we will grant
access on request. Please contact bci-github@bristol.ac.uk for
information.
